🧥 WTWR – What To Wear

WTWR is a full-stack web app I built to solve a simple but surprisingly tricky problem: figuring out what to wear based on the weather. The idea came from those mornings where you check the forecast, stare at your closet, and still feel unsure. WTWR takes the guesswork out by combining real-time weather data with your personal wardrobe, offering outfit suggestions that actually make sense.

This project gave me a chance to dive deeper into full-stack development, work with external APIs, and design something that’s both useful and enjoyable to use. It’s fast, clean, and built with real people in mind.

🔧 How It Works

WTWR runs on the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js—and is designed with a focus on simplicity, accessibility, and responsiveness.

🧠 Backend

• Built with Node.js and Express, acting as a proxy to the OpenWeather API
• RESTful endpoints handle:• User login and authentication
• Clothing item management (add, edit, delete)
• Weather-based outfit logic

• MongoDB stores user data, clothing items, and preferences
• JWT tokens keep sessions secure and persistent


🎨 Frontend

• Developed with React, using functional components and hooks
• Navigation handled via React Router
• Styled using BEM-based CSS for clean, modular design
• Semantic HTML and ARIA roles ensure accessibility across devices

📈 Where It Could Go

WTWR has room to grow into something even more powerful. Here are a few directions I’m exploring:

• Smarter Recommendations: Learn from user feedback to improve outfit suggestions over time
• Retail Integration: Suggest purchasable items from partner brands based on weather and style
• Premium Features: Offer wardrobe analytics, seasonal planning tools, and personalized style coaching
• Social Sharing: Let users share outfits, follow friends, and build a fashion-forward community
• Data Insights: Help brands understand seasonal trends through anonymized user behavior

🆕 What’s Coming Next

I’m actively working on new features to make WTWR even more helpful:

• Outfit history and calendar view
• Dark mode toggle for better usability
• Push notifications for weather changes and outfit alerts
• AI-powered styling based on your wardrobe and preferences
• Multi-city support for travelers
• Advanced filtering by temperature, occasion, and clothing type
• Social features like sharing wardrobes and following friends
• Performance upgrades for faster load times and smoother mobile experience

🏁 Wrapping It Up

WTWR started as a way to combine weather data with fashion logic, and it’s grown into a tool I’m genuinely proud of. It’s clean, intuitive, and solves a real problem that most people face daily. Along the way, I’ve learned a ton about building scalable features, working with APIs, and designing for real users—not just developers.

And the best part? It’s just getting started.
